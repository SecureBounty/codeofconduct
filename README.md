### 2. No Harassment

Harassment, in any form, is strictly prohibited. This includes but is not limited to offensive comments, discrimination, personal attacks, and unwelcome advances. Be mindful of your language and actions, and remember that what might be a harmless joke to one person could be hurtful to another.

### 3. Professional Conduct

Maintain professional conduct at all times. Focus on the technical aspects of discussions and avoid personal or irrelevant matters. Disagreements are normal, but remember to express your opinions respectfully.

### 4. Open Collaboration

Be courteous in your interactions with others. Keep in mind that we may have different cultural backgrounds and communication styles. Assume good intentions and seek to understand before responding.

### 6. No Spam or Advertising

Avoid posting spam or promoting personal or commercial ventures unrelated to SecureBounty. Discussions and contributions should align with the organization's purpose and goals.

### 7. Respect Project Maintainers

Respect the decisions made by project maintainers. They have the final say on accepting or rejecting contributions and managing the repository.
